# Introduction

Grace is a modern fashion e-commerce platform developed with **Laravel 9**, following enterprise-level software engineering principles and modern architectural practices.

The platform is designed to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience while offering administrators a powerful dashboard for managing products, categories, users, orders, reviews, notifications, and other business operations.

Unlike traditional academic CRUD projects, Grace has been engineered with a strong emphasis on maintainability, scalability, code reusability, performance optimization, and security.

The application combines a clean user experience with a modular backend architecture, allowing new features to be integrated with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

---

# Running the Project

After completing the installation steps, the application will be available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

From there, users can:

- Browse products
- Create accounts
- Place orders
- Manage wishlist
- Manage cart
- Manage addresses
- Write reviews
- Complete payments
- Track orders

Administrators can access the dashboard to manage every aspect of the platform.

# Security Highlights

Security has been considered throughout the development lifecycle.

Implemented security measures include:

- Authentication & Authorization
- Route Protection & Rate Limiting
- Middleware-Based Access Control
- HTTP Response Security Headers
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)** with dynamic nonces and style hashes
    - **Clickjacking Protection** (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `frame-ancestors`)
    - **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** with preload and subdomains
    - **Cross-Origin Isolation** (`COOP`, `CORP`, `COEP credentialless`)
    - **MIME-Type Sniffing Protection** (`nosniff`)
    - **Permissions Policy** (restricts camera, microphone, geolocation)
    - **Strict Referrer Policy**
- Dynamic Route-Based Cache Control (prevents caching sensitive pages while preserving bfcache for public routes)
- CSRF Protection
- SQL Injection Protection
- XSS Protection
- Request Validation
- Password Hashing
- Secure Sessions
- Remember Me Authentication
- Social Login Authentication
- Secure Stripe Payment Integration
- Environment-Based Secrets Management
- Input Sanitization
- Secure File Upload Handling
- Soft Delete Strategy
- Error Handling

These mechanisms work together to provide a secure shopping experience for both customers, monitors, and administrators.
